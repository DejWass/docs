# Tasks during contract processes

There are different tasks during stages Review, Approval, and Signature that users need to take care of. Those tasks are in the form of activity entity **Task** records. They remind you of actions you need to do.

## What do I find in the task record

When you open the task, you will find there **Subject**, **Description** and in **Regarding** attribute, there will be the record you need to take care of.

## Where do I find the tasks

You can see the tasks in two places in the TALXIS Contract. The first place is the **My Contracts And Tasks** dashboard, and the second one is the timeline of the record on which you need to take action.

### Dashboard

In the **My Contracts And Tasks** dashboard, there is a tasks view with all your tasks.

### Timeline

When you go to any contract record, you'll find there a timeline. It is used to store activities linked to a record. You will find more about timelines and how to operate with them here: [Timeline](/en/user-guide/model-driven-apps/basic-app-elements/timeline/).
