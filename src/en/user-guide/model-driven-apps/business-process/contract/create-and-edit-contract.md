# Create and edit contract

Contract entity is here for you to keep all important information about contracts in one place. It will help you to keep an overview of their stages, validity, comments, and other data you need to know.

## Where to find them?

Contracts have their group in the main area of the TALXIS Contract application sitemap. A sitemap is a menu on the left side and it is divided into groups. You can find more about them here: [Sitemap](/en/user-guide/model-driven-apps/basic-app-elements/sitemap/). When you click on **All** in the **Contracts** group, you'll be navigated to a view with all contract records. A view is a formatted table of records. It shows you records in rows with their attributes in columns.
