2. Click the **Terminate Contract** button in the ribbon.

4. Click the **Close Contract** button.

After termination finishes, the page will reload and you will see your terminated contract.

## Contract with amendments

If you terminate a contract with amendments, it will also end the amendments.

Valid amendments will have a new status reason **Cancelled**, and drafted ones will be **Discarded**.
