# Managing contracts

**Contract management** can help you create order within your contract processes. With our solution, you can easily keep a database of contracts with data like validity, contract statuses and even see documents related to contract records stored in SharePoint right from the app. You'll be able to run various processes like multiple review rounds, approvals from representatives, and even electronic signature thanks to integration with [Signi](https://signi.com/).
