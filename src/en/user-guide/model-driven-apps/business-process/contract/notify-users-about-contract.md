# Notify other users about the contract

During the contract stages, you can choose users to be informed about the contract. They will receive emails about the contract moving through stages. You will use this feature to inform users that are not part of processes like review or approval. These users have to be specified per contract.

## How the notification looks

## When are the notifications sent

Notifications are sent when a contract enters one of these stages:

- Review
- Waiting for Approval
- Sent for Signature
- Valid

## Where to specify users

1. Navigate to the contract you want to inform users about.
2. Go to the **Additional Users** tab. There is the **Inform** subgrid at the bottom.
