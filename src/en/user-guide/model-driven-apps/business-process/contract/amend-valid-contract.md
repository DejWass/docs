# Amend valid contract

Amendments are for modificating, correcting, deleting from, or adding to existing contracts.

We have a simple solution so you can comfortably create new amendments to an existing contract using one button. Amendments are tracked as type **Amendment** whether their parent contracts have type **Original contract**. You'll find all amendments on the parent contract in the **Amendments** tab.

> **Note**: You can amend only contracts with status reason **Valid**.

## Create an amendment

1. Navigate to the valid contract you want to amend.
2. Click the **Create Amendment** button.

On the top of the form, there is a ribbon where you'll find a button called **Create Amendment** if the contract is **Valid**.

A background process will take care of the rest. After it finishes, it'll navigate you to the new amendment.

3. New amendment.

After the new amendment form opens you can notice that the basic information is identical to its parent. Only attributes **Document Type** and **Parent Contract** are different. **Document Type** is **Amendment** and **Parent Contract** refers to the original contract.

## See all original contract amendments

1. Navigate to the original contract.
2. Choose the **Amendments** tab.

All amendments related to this original contract are here.
