# Create and manage quotes
Quote is basically offer with products or services. You are trying to create a quote that would meet customer expectations.

A sale typically starts with a draft quote. A quote undergoes several revisions between the salesperson and customer before it is accepted. After the quote is accepted, an order is generated from the quote.

You'll probably edit a quote multiple times as a sale progresses. Initially, you create a draft, and then you need to accept it by a customer.

## Ways to create quote
There are several ways to create a quote. Let's take a look at them:
### Create a quote from an opportunity

1) In the site map, select **Opportunities**.

2) Select the opportunity you want to create a quote for.

3) Select **Quotes** tab or just click on **Create Quote** button in command bar.

> The steps below are linked to creating a quote via subgrid.

You should see Quotes subgrid.

4) Create new **Quote**.

The **Quote** form opens.

5) Fill in the fields.

When you create a quote from an opportunity, you don't need to fill in the fields. Most field values come from the originating opportunity. In the header you can see orginating opportunity. If you want you can change the subject for example to have a better overview of your quotes.

6) Save form

If you return to the opportunity you created the quote for, you will see a new item in the _Quotes_ subgrid.

Once the customer approves the quote we can accept it. To accept a quote, we need to have at least one product in the quote. See [Add products to quote](/en/user-guide/model-driven-apps/business-process/sales/add-products-to-quote-order/).

After accepting the quote, the quote will be locked and cannot be edited. You can unlock it again using the redraft button.

Quote can be accepted directly from its form by pressing the **Accepted by Customer** button
