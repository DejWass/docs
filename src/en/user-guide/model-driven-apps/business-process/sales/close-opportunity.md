After closing the opportunity, the record is locked and cannot be edited.

### Close as won with orders
If your application uses orders, you must continue through the orders dialog. To proceed, you must have at least one confirm order. See [Create and manage order](/en/user-guide/model-driven-apps/business-process/sales/create-and-manage-order/). Then a **Close as Won** dialog will open.
