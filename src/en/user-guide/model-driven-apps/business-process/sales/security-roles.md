# Security and user privileges
A privilege defines how different users, such as salespeople, access different types of records. In smaller companies, it doesn't matter much about defining privileges, but for larger corporations, these security and user privileges are useful. Imagine that we have a company that consists of three managers and three departments and one head of the company. We don't want the first department to see the contacts owned by the second department and vice versa. Therefore, security and user privileges are defined to prevent access to data between departments. If the first department needs to see some records from the second department, the manager of the first department who has the privilege of seeing the records of other departments can see this data and provide it to his department. Head of the company can manipulate and display data from all departments.
