# Create or edit Opportunities in sales process

In Sales process, an **opportunity** is a potential sale, like a lead, but with an opportunity you can forecast revenue, set a estimated close date, or current situation for the sale. You can also track activities in timeline that are performed with opportunity or set scheduled follow-up activity.


## Ways to create opportunities

You can convert qualified leads to opportunities without reentering the data, and then you can track opportunities through the sales cycle. When you convert a qualified lead to an opportunity, you can access the lead record, which includes activities and notes, from the corresponding opportunity form.

-OR-

You can create a new opportunity that didn't originate from a lead.

> The preferred way is to create an opportunity from a lead. See [Qualify and convert a lead to an opportunity](/en/user-guide/model-driven-apps/business-process/sales/create-and-manage-lead/#qualify-and-convert-a-lead-to-an-opportunity).

## Create Opportunity

1) In the site map, select **Opportunity**.

2) Create an opportunity from the Opportunities list using **New** button.

The Opportunity form opens.

Required fields:

6) In the **Develop** stage, select **Next Stage**.

After the develop stage, you are trying to create a proposed solution for your opportunity. A solution that the customer would accept and was beneficial for both parties. These solutions can be in the form of [quote](/en/user-guide/model-driven-apps/business-process/sales/create-or-edit-quote/) or notes.

## Approval of proposed solutions
