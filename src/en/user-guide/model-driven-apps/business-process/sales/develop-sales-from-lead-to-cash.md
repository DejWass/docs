# Develop sales from lead to cash

The **Sales process** can help you close more sales and achieve higher customer satisfaction. You can achieve more consistent sales interactions by following the sales process as it takes you through each stage, from creating a lead to closing the sale. You also end up with a more complete history, which you can refer to later on if you plan to work with your customer again in the future, or if your customer needs support.
