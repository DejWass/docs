# Create an manage purchase invoice
In this section we will show you how to create a purchase invoice and what else is on the purchase invoice form.

## What is a purchase invoice?
It is a document that is issued by the purchaser of goods and services, confirming that the order is indeed valid and has been fulfilled by the seller. This invoice is created after the purchase order which is issued by the purchaser to the seller. The due date on the purchase invoice is the date by which the purchaser commits to pay the seller for the itemized goods and services.

##  Where to find them?
All purchase invoices can be found in the **Purchase invoice** group on the [sitemap](/en/user-guide/model-driven-apps/basic-app-elements/sitemap/). This group divides into subareas: **New, Pending for approval, Pre-approved, Closed, Paid, All** according to which stage of the [business process flow](/en/user-guide/model-driven-apps/basic-app-elements/business-process-flow/) the purchase invoice is currently in.

After clicking on one of the subareas, a view with records will open. More about views [here](/en/user-guide/model-driven-apps/basic-app-elements/views/).
