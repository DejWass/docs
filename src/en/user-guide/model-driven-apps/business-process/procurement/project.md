# Create and manage a project
Each purchase invoice belongs to a specific project so that we have an overview when issuing invoices.

## Where are the projects?
All projects can be found in the **Projects** group on the [sitemap](/en/user-guide/model-driven-apps/basic-app-elements/sitemap/).

After clicking on the **Active** subarea, a view with records will open. More about views [here](/en/user-guide/model-driven-apps/basic-app-elements/views/).

3. Fill in a form.  
There are many fields in the form that can be filled in. Not all fields and [controls](/en/user-guide/model-driven-apps/basic-app-elements/controls/) are available immediately after opening the form, but only after saving the form.

To create a project, just enter the **project name**, as this field is **required**.

There are also other fields on the form such as scheduled project start, Expected cost, expected income, etc.

4. Save the form  
The saved form should look like the photo below.

## Timeline
The **timeline** is used to store **activities** linked to a record. More information about timeline [here](/en/user-guide/model-driven-apps/basic-app-elements/timeline/).

## Accounts
Within the project, you can include the accounts to which the project applies. To add an account, press three dots and add an existing account.

Never delete records, always deactivate them.
