# Sent a purchase invoice for approval
After the purchase invoice is created, we can send it for approval. If you have not yet created a purchase invoice, see this page: [Create a purchase invoice](/en/user-guide/model-driven-apps/business-process/procurement/create-purchase-invoice/).

1. Open the record with purchase invoice.
2. Select a **Prepare Purchase Invoice** stage and press the **Next Stage** button.

You will be moved to the next stage **Pending For Approval** and the purchase invoice record will be read-only to prevent its editing.

In the [timeline](/en/user-guide/model-driven-apps/basic-app-elements/timeline/) you can see a note that the approval process has started:

It is now up to the approvers to [approve the purchase invoice](/en/user-guide/model-driven-apps/business-process/procurement/approve-purchase-invoice/).
