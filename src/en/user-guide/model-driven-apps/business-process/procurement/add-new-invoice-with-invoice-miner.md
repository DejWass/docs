# Create new purchase invoice with Invoice Miner
TALXIS Procurement uses Invoice Miner, a cloud-based service developed by Konica Minolta, to extract data from purchase invoices submitted for processing in pdf format. To ensure accuracy, extracted data are reviewed and updated manually using Correction UI. This interface allows users to verify, modify and accept the data before the new purchase invoice record is created.

## Submit new document for processing
In standard solution the document is submitted for processing by uploading the document to specific folder in SharePoint. This can be automated by collecting the invoices from email for example. Only pdf format is supported.

## Verify, modify and accept extracted data in Correction UI
As soon as the processing extraction of data is completed, user can see a new document in section Needs Attention. This document can be opened by double clicking on row or clicking on the name of the document.

After opening the document in status of Needs Attention, the Correction UI is displayed in dialog. There the user can see all the extracted, verify them and modify if needed.
