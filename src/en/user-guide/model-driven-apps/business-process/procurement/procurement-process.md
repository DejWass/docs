# Procurement process
In this article we will look at how the **procurement process** works. It all starts with the creation of a purchase invoice, which should be approved before it is issued, continues with the approval process and finally with its confirmation of payment. 

The following users are involved in the process:
- **owner** who created the purchase invoice.
- **chief approvers** who are in charge of approving the purchase invoice.
- **category level approvers** who approve an invoice based on whether the purchased product falls under their category. 
- **accountant** who confirms that a payment has been sent.
