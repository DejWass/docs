# Lookup control
Lookup control occurs in fields where you need to enter a related record. Usually these fields have a magnifying glass.

To use lookup control, you have to click on the box. You should see list of **Recent records** (in the picture below Recent Accounts) and then press **Enter** or click **All records**.
