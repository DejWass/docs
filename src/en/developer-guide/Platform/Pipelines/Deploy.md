# **Creating a deploy pipeline for a project**
In this guide, we assume that you already have a project, a repository and a [build pipeline](src/en/developer-guide/Platform/Pipelines/Build.md) created in DevOps, and what you need right now is to deploy build solutions to an environment. 

[build pipeline guide](src/en/developer-guide/Platform/Pipelines/Build.md)

Make sure environment is [configured for deploy](https://dev.azure.com/thenetworg/INT0006/_wiki/wikis/INT0006.wiki/318/Environment-Configuration). 
Note: we use production configuration on our DEV instances. Do not use DEV/TEST configuration!
