File Explorer PCF (PowerApps Component Framework) control enables secure file interactions with SharePoint via Microsoft Graph API.
For more information about neccessary app consents, please refer to [this page](/docs/src/en/customizer-guide/required-application-consent.md#talxis---pcffilepicker).

After a successful authentication with the consented Azure app, the token is exchanged with securitytokens.services.talxis.com, a custom atuhentication service, which exchanges the App token for a MS Graph token with desired scopes. This is done using [On-Behalf-Of-Flow pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow)

That token is then used to access SharePoint resources via Microsoft Graph API, allowing the control to perform file operations such as upload, download, and delete.

For more information, please refer to the [internal documentation](https://dev.azure.com/thenetworg/INT0015/_wiki/wikis/INT0015.wiki/4301/Authentication-Flow)
