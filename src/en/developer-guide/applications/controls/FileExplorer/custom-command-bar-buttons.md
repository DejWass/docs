# Custom Command Bar Buttons

_File Explorer_ control can be extended to support custom command bar buttons, which can trigger / cause some action.

## Configuration

These buttons can be added through configuration. First of all, make sure that you have a [collaboration workspace template record](/en/developer-guide/applications/controls/FileExplorer/collaborationworkspaces/#collaboration-workspace-template) created. This record is defining the features of an individual _File Explorer_ control instance. Once that is sorted out, you can start adding buttons in the **üñ±Ô∏è Custom Buttons** tab.

Here you add a new button (record) to the existing _File Explorer_ control instance. These records can be then exported and versioned in the data package through `pac tool cmt` cli command, which opens _Configuration Migration Tool_ on your local machine.

| File Name Filter                | Allows you to show the button only for a specific type of file. Example: `*.*` allows to select only files and not folders. There is [`minimatch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimatch) library used for evaluation of these expressions. |

| Icon Name          | Name of the Fluent UI icon that you wish to use. The icons are referenced in _PascalCase_ notation. You can use [this resource](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/fluent-mdl2/) to find the right icon. |

\* : Localized JSON objects can be used. These values are not known at design time and due to the localization requirement, this was the best value / effort solution. The object has string _lcid_ (language codes) for properties with translated values. Example: `{ "1033": "This is the english localized value.", "1029": "Tohle je ƒçesk√Ω p≈ôeklad." }`.
