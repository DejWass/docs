# Git Workflow - Branching Strategy
We use customized [git-flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) since we need to support and maintain multiple builds of TALXIS in production environments. It helps us isolate development of individial features to prevent unwanted changes merged to production code.
